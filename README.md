# NG-NL 2016 contest

Create a web game with AngularJS that allows a player to (manually) solve a nonogram ("Japanese puzzle").

## Input

We have provided one puzzle as JS arrays of filled box count in each row and column. See `nonogramData.js` for the puzzle data.
Make sure that your web game can play at least this puzzle.

## Output

The game should have a user interface so it can be played, but it's up to you how to represent it. See 
http://www.goobix.com/games/nonograms for an example.

Bonus points for:

  - telling the player that the nonogram is solved
  - a hint feature
  - an automatic solver
  - a board editor
  - other creative extras :)

The game has to be implemented using AngularJS 1.x or 2.0 beta. Other dependencies, transpilers, packagers etc. are allowed.
Make sure that your game contains clear instructions on how to start it.
